READING THE TEXT FILE

Works by using ifstream to read the file, then reads each line separated by comas to get each product info and finally adds it to an array.

BUBBLE SORTING PRODUCTS BY PRICE

Bubble sorting works by repeatedly stepping through the array, compares adjacent elements in the array, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. We want to be able to sort the price either from top to bottom or bottom to top so that is controlled by the “Ascending” bool.

INSERTION SORTING


(Insertion sorting algorithm, used to sort price in a range)

(Sorting product price in a range)


(Products sorted in range of 700-900)














UPDATE
Update is very simple, where to start we simply load the products then print each product after every sorting algorithm.
